review: "Great story about a high achieving addict whose life is going well on the surface but in absolute turmoil on the inside. He turns his life around through ultra endurance sports including Triathlon. It was enlightening
to understand alcoholism from the alcoholic's perspective. His crazy triathlon and endurance running stories are highly entertaining. The last fourth is about eating vegan which I admittedly did not read."

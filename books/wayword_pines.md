rating: "8"

genre: "Fiction"

review: "I'm a huge fan of the first two Blake Crouch books I've read (Dark Matter and Recursion), so I was excited to read some of his earlier works. This trilogy was captivating. It kept me excited to pick up again each night. The story follows a secret service agent who wakes up after a car wreck in a strange, suspicious town. I held back a few points because the novels get very gory at times which I didn't enjoy reading."
